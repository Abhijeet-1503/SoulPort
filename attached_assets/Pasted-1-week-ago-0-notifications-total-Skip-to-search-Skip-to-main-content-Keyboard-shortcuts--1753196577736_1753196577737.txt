The last 30 days have been nothing short of transformative.
I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed the Student Research Internship Training (SRIT) organized by the Department of Computer Engineering and the Research Activities Club at Marwadi University.
Over the course of this online internship, I got the opportunity to dive deep into critical care data and work on one of the most challenging problems in healthcare—early sepsis detection using federated learning and transformer-based AI models.
This wasn’t just another research task—it was about building something that could genuinely shift clinical workflows from reactive treatment to proactive prevention.
A huge thank you to Dr. Ravikumar R Natarajan and Dr. Sushil Kumar Singh for their constant guidance, mentorship, and the space to explore.
Also grateful for the certificate and the captured memories 📜📸 that made this even more special.

A Day to Remember with the Circuitology Club Club

Last week was one of those rare days that left me inspired and excited about learning. I attended the NE 555 Timer IC Workshop organized by the Circuitology Club, and it was nothing short of amazing.

The session began with a warm welcome, followed by an insightful introduction to the basics of the 555 Timer IC. I must say Dhwani Desai , Diva Parekh , Rishi Sampat , and Ruhan completely stole the show with their incredible presentation skills. Their ability to explain complex topics with such clarity made it feel like they were seasoned professionals. As someone interacting with circuits for the first time, I truly appreciated the effort they put into making the session beginner-friendly yet engaging.

The workshop was structured beautifully. After a theory session, we had a fun, competitive quiz that sparked some friendly rivalry among us. Then came the highlight of the day—a hands-on session where the real magic happened.

Working as a team, 
garima singh 
Devarsh Bhatt 
we built three fascinating projects:
1️⃣ An Automation Street Light that responds to light conditions.
2️⃣ Adjustable Flashing LED Circuits that showcased the versatility of the 555 Timer IC.
3️⃣ A Machine Gun Sound Generator—a quirky project that added a fun twist to the learning experience.

This workshop was more than just about circuits; it was about teamwork, innovation, and the joy of creating something with your own hands. I walked away with not just knowledge but also a renewed enthusiasm for exploring the world of electronics.

Kudos to the Circuitology Club for organizing such a memorable event. I can’t wait to see what they have in store for us next!

A Day Immersed in AR guided by the brilliant Chhavi Garg . A co-founder of Arexa and a force of inspiration, she walked into the room not merely as a speaker, but as a spark, igniting a fire within us all. In partnership with Snap Inc. and Bharat XR , her presence turned the hall into a space brimming with ideas, possibilities, and uncharted dreams.

She started with the smallest of steps—humble beginnings that, when pieced together, unfolded into something breathtakingly intricate. Terms we thought were mundane gained new life as she unraveled their meaning, bridging gaps between understanding and application. With wisdom both sharp and compassionate, she shifted our mindset from students to creators, from dreamers to business-minded professionals, showing us that the key to greatness lies in understanding our audience.
For someone like me, an AR/VR enthusiast shaped by childhood dreams of virtual worlds, this was no ordinary workshop. Having grown up immersed in the futuristic allure of VR-inspired animes like Sword Art Online, I’ve always envisioned creating immersive worlds of my own. 
In a brief but amazing session we undertook two transformative projects:

1. Image Tracking Filter on Snapchat
We ventured into the realm of Generative AI, exploring its role as a revolutionary tool in animation and AR. Chavi guided us through the intricacies of Lens Studio, leading us from the fundamentals to advanced techniques. With her expertise and tools like Easy lens, we brought animated character filters to life. The moment she revealed how to publish them for free, even for commercial use, felt surreal—a quiet triumph that made me feel truly empowered.

2. Object-Based Filter Creation
This project was nothing short of magic. We crafted a filter capable of identifying specific objects and triggering preprogrammed animations or markers. The creativity it unlocked was boundless, and for a moment, I couldn’t help but imagine the myriad possibilitiesboth mischievous and groundbreaking. It was a vivid reminder of the vast potential AR holds.

What made it all the more extraordinary was Chavi herself—her warmth, her wit, and the way she engaged with us. The session culminated in a dynamic quiz, a storm of ideas and insights that pushed our minds to think bigger, bolder, and beyond the ordinary.

It’s hard to find words that truly encapsulate what this event meant to me. It wasn’t just about learning new tools or techniques—it was about discovering a part of myself that had been waiting for a spark like this. Though Chavi’s session was short, its impact will echo for a lifetime, guiding me as I step further into the world of AR.

A heartfelt thank you to Nandini Lashkari Lashkari for bringing this event to life, IEEE WIE MEFGI for their tireless efforts, Foram Chandarana ma’am for her unwavering mentorship, Snap AR and Bharat XR for their support, and our provost, R.B. Jadega, along with Marwadi University , for granting us this remarkable opportunity.

What a start to the National Seminar on CV and Image Processing (NaSCoVIP 2024) at GCET, Anand! 🌟
We kicked things off with the presence of some incredible figures—Dr. Hardik Pathak, Dr kalpesh wandra, Dr. Kiran Amin, and Dr. Kaushik Nath—who inspired us with their opening addresses. The energy in the room was already sky-high, but it was Dr. Wandra’s talk on the next generation of surveillance systems that took things to a whole new level. 🚀
Imagine surveillance systems evolving from plain video recording to real-time, AI-driven response generators. He touched on everything from edge computing to the role of AI and machine learning in automating national security systems. With CV, we’re talking about facial recognition, anomaly detection, and automated threat alerts that could revolutionize public safety. He also discussed how the integration of IoT and 5G will push surveillance into new dimensions—like a smart city but with extra layers of protection. 🏙️🛡️
Loved how Dr. Wandra outlined the transition from traditional surveillance to predictive surveillance, a shift from being reactive to becoming proactive. Real-time threat identification and automated systems for national security? The future's looking smarter (and safer) already!
After that came Dr. Praveen Tomar, Head of Data Automation at OFGEM (UK Civil Services), on the real-life applications of High-Resolution OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and Google Cloud Vision API. 🚀
Dr. Tomar highlighted some fascinating use cases, including:
🔍 Crime Prevention: Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and weapon detection to boost public safety.
📄 Document Verification: Leveraging AI for real-time fake content detection in images and videos, as well as social media monitoring.
⚖️ Fraud Prevention: OCR helps detect online fraud and automate critical public services for enhanced accuracy and cost savings.
Key OCR tools discussed included Rossum, Amazon Textract, ABBYY, Tesseract, and more. It was amazing to learn about how these tools are transforming the way industries manage data, making processes more efficient and reliable.
Aside from the tech insights, Dr. Tomar gave some invaluable life advice:
Networking is your net worth 🤝
Build habits and focus on continuous learning 📚
Be a problem solver with a critical thinking mindset 🔧
A great takeaway from Atomic Habits by James Clear was to focus on systems, not goals, as small habits compound over time and lead to big results.
Big shoutout to Biswaranjan Acharya, PhD Sir for encouraging us to participate in this event, and a huge thank you to the @GCET Student Branch for organizing such a fantastic experience! Looking forward to more insights in the next session! 🤩

Today, on 5th October 2024, we completed Phase 1 of the IoT Enabled Human-Centered Design Workshop as part of EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Services) by Prof.Chandrasinh Parmar (HOD - Dept of ICT) and Prof. Foram Chandarana (IEEE R10 HTA). What started as a planned session from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM evolved into a full-day engagement, extending until 4:30 PM, fueled by the incredible enthusiasm of the students.

The workshop began with an inspiring video on the IDEO Shopping Cart Case Study, which highlighted the importance of diversity in teams and how creative thinking can be implemented. Students were divided into teams and engaged in meaningful discussions, focusing on real-world problem statements such as:
1. Kidnapping Prevention through Geofencing: Exploring how IoT can enhance child safety.
2. Smart Cradle Technology for Working Mothers: Addressing the stress working mothers face with features like a mother’s voice, cry detectors, and automatic toys.
3. Call Management During Driving: After brainstorming, teams proposed an app that notifies callers if someone is driving, offering voicemail or urgent call options, and discussed Computer Vision (CV) for real-time detection.

We also explored the importance of teamwork by reflecting on project failures and the lessons learned, emphasizing proper team selection, enthusiasm, and the value of soft skills and team management.

To conclude, each team was tasked with identifying challenges faced by university communities, focusing on Activities, Objects, Uses, Interactions, and Environment, which we will present next week.

The energy and hands-on approach made it a truly inspiring session. We eagerly look forward to continuing in Phase 2 with Dr. Amit Ved (IEEE R10 MD) and Mr. Shashank Bagda(Chair IEEE MEFGI Student branch) next week!

IEEE Day Celebration at Marwadi University: A Journey of Innovation and Learning

I had the privilege of attending the IEEE Day Celebration at Marwadi University, organized by the IEEE MEFGI Branch under the guidance of Dr. Biswaranjan Acharya, PhD Acharya, IEEE Student Branch Counselor, Marwadi University. It was an inspiring event that marked my official entry as an IEEE student member, opening doors to new opportunities for learning and engaging with the broader engineering community.

The event featured two thought-provoking expert talks by esteemed speakers.

1. Smartphones as Platforms for Health Sensing 
 Delivered by Dr.Kalyan Sasidhar P.S, Associate Professor at DA-IICT, Gandhinagar, this talk explored how mobile sensing technology is revolutionizing health monitoring. Dr. Sasidhar highlighted the immense potential of smartphones, embedded with sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, and heart rate monitors, to gather real-world data that can be used for health-related insights. His session included a detailed case study where smartphone sensor data from IICT Gandhinagar students was collected over 95 days to map their mobility patterns, track daily activities, and analyze sleep interruptions. This demonstrated how mobile sensing can extend beyond healthcare into fields such as behavioral research and mental health monitoring.

2. Fairness in AI-based Decision Making 
 Dr. Manisha Padala, Assistant Professor at IIT Gandhinagar, gave an insightful talk on fairness in AI systems. She emphasized the critical role of bias removal in machine learning datasets to ensure fair and accurate predictions. Through examples like the COMPAS software, she illustrated the real-world consequences of biased AI models. Dr. Padala also discussed different stages of mitigating bias—pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing—and techniques to ensure that AI models achieve fairness, including demographic parity and equalized odds. Her session underscored the need to build equitable AI systems that are both technically sound and socially responsible.

Our Pro Vice Chancellor, Prof. (Dr.) Rajendrasinh Jadeja, who also serves as IEEE Region-10 Vice Chair for Member Activities, emphasized the immense benefits of IEEE membership in fostering innovation and knowledge-sharing within the global community.

The event was a resounding success, and I extend my gratitude to the entire organizing team, especially Dr. Biswaranjan Acharya, PhD Acharya, for making this celebration possible. Special thanks to Dr. Madhu Shukla, Head of MARWADI UNIVERSITY CE- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, for his invaluable support and contributions.
